## Looking at the variables 

# stratum - triplet no. each triplet consists of one infant whose mother died (a case) and two controls, 
# i.e. infants whos mother did not die. Matched on the covariates below: 

# enter - Age (in days) of case when its mother died
# exit - Age (in days) at death or right censoring (at age 365 days)
# event - Follow up ends with death (1) or right censoring (0)
# mother - dead for cases, alive for controls
# age - Mother's age at infant's birth
# sex - The infant's sex 
# parish - Birth parish, either Nedertornea or not Nedertornea (other)
# civst - Civil status of mother, married or unmarried
# ses - Socio economic status of mothe, either farmer or not farmer (other)
# year - Year of birth of the infant

# Question 1
#########################################################

# We're interested in modeling the historical causes of child mortality. 
# We have data from 26855 children born in Skellefte√•, Sweden from 1850 to 1884.
# Using the "child" dataset in the eha library, fit a Cox Proportional Hazard Model usinf mother's age 
# and infant's gender as covariates. 
# Present and interpret the output.

# In order to fit a Cox Proportional Hazard Model the coxph() function from the 'survival' package is required
# this needs to be in a Surv() format which represents time to event data.
# the first argument is time variable

### Testing with Weibull proportional hazard model

# Proportional hazards model with parametric baseline hazard(s). 
# Allows for stratification with different scale and shape in each stratum, and left truncated and right censored data.

fit <- coxreg(Surv(enter, exit, event) ~ strata(stratum) + mother, data
              = infants)
fit
fit.w <- phreg(Surv(enter, exit, event) ~ mother + parish + ses, data =
                 infants)
summary(fit.w) ## Weibull proportional hazards model.
plot(fit.w)

coef(fit.w) # for extracting the coefficients from the model


infants_s <- with(infants, Surv(enter, exit, event))
stargazer(infants)

# The Kaplan-Meier method is a non parametric statistic that allows you to estimate the survival function

# plotting Kaplan-Meier method
kaplan <- survfit(infants_s ~ 1, data = infants)
summary(kaplan, times = seq(0, 15, 1))

plot(kaplan, main = "Kaplan-Meier Method", xlab = "Days", ylim = c(0.5, 1)) 
autoplot(kaplan)

# plotting the sex covariates using the infants gender , girl and boy
kaplan_sex <- survfit(infants_s ~ sex, data = infants)
autoplot(kaplan_sex)

# running the Cox Proportional Hazard Model, using mothers age and infants gender as the covariates 
cox <- coxph(Surv(enter, exit, event) ~ age + sex, data = infants)
summary(cox)

############ Interpretation

# there is a .485 decrease in the expected log of the hazard for male babies in comparison to female babies,
# while holding the age of the moether constant

# there is .04 decrease in the expected log of of the hazrd each time the mothers age increases by 1 year or 1 unit increase
# while holding the sex of infant constant

# coef    exp(coef) se(coef)                  z Pr(>|z|)
# age    -0.04044   0.96037  0.04507 -0.897    0.370
# sexboy -0.48518   0.61559  0.44224 -1.097    0.273


### hazard ratio for male babies is .61 compared to that of female babies or 62 male babies die for every 100 female babies
